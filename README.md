# Tutorial:
1 - Drop the Size_Scanner.exe file in the "folder" that you want to scan
2 - Open it
3 - Wait for calculation
4 - Do you want to save the outputs?
YES:
its will save the outputs in a file that you choose (or you can create one)
NO:
its will close and will not give you any outputs
5 - Open that file that you saved the outputs in it
6 - Read the top 10 location + size



# Example:
I got 1000mg file in C:\~~~~~~~~~\Example.txt
I DONT NEED THAT FILE SO IM SAFE IF I DELETED IT



# WARNING:
